                        <h2>The end of Legend</h2>
                        <p style="font-size: 1.8rem;">Villeneuve died in a 140 mph (225 km/h) crash caused by a collision with the March of Jochen
                            Mass during qualifying for the 1982 Belgian Grand Prix at Zolder.
                            The accident came less than two weeks after an intense argument with his teammate, Didier
                            Pironi, over Pironi's move to pass Villeneuve at the preceding San Marino Grand Prix.
                            At the time of his death, Villeneuve was extremely popular with fans and has since become
                            an iconic figure in the history of the sport. His son, Jacques Villeneuve, became
                            Formula One world champion in 1997 and, to date, the only Canadian to win the
                            F1 Championship.
                        </p>

                            <em>Gilles did not win any championships, but he won the respect and admiration of F1 lovers until the end of time...</em>
